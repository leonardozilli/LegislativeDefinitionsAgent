High-pressure sodium (HPS) light sources that do not fulfil condition (a) are considered light sources for the purposes of this Regulation. Light sources do not include: (a) LED dies or LED chips; (b) LED packages; (c) products containing light source(s) from which these light source(s) can be removed for verification; (d) light-emitting parts contained in a light source from which these parts cannot be removed for verification as a light source; (2) \"\" control gear \"\" means one or more devices, that may or may not be physically integrated in a light source, intended to prepare the mains for the electric format required by one or more specific light sources within boundary conditions set by electric safety and electromagnetic compatibility. It may include transforming the supply and starting voltage, limiting operational and preheating current, preventing cold starting, correcting the power factor and/or reducing radio interference. The term \"\"control gear\"\" does not include power supplies within the scope of Commission Regulation (EC) No 278/2009 Commission Regulation (EC) No 278/2009 of 6 April 2009 implementing Directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for no-load condition electric power consumption and average active efficiency of external power supplies ( OJ L 93, 7.4.2009, p. 3 ). \"\" Power-over-Ethernet switch \"\" PoE switch\"\" means equipment for power-supply and data-handling that is installed between the mains and office equipment and/or light sources for the purpose of data transfer and power supply; (3) \"\"separate control gear\"\", means a control gear that is not physically integrated with a light source and is placed on the market as a separate product or as a part of a containing product; (4) \"\" containing product \"\" means a product containing one or more light sources, or separate control gears, or both. Examples of containing products are luminaires that can be taken apart to allow separate verification of the contained light source(s), household appliances containing light source(s), furniture (shelves, mirrors, display cabinets) containing light source(s). If a containing product cannot be taken apart for verification of the light source and separate control gear, the entire containing product is to be considered a light source; (5) \"\" light \"\" means electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 380 nm and 780 nm; (6) \"\"mains\"\" or \"\"mains voltage\"\" (MV) means the electricity supply of 230 (± 10 %) volt of alternating current at 50 Hz; (7) \"\" LED die \"\" or \"\"LED chip\"\" means a small block of light-emitting semiconducting material on which a functional LED circuit is fabricated; (8) \"\" LED package \"\" means a single electric part comprising principally at least one LED die. It does not include a control gear or parts of it, a cap or active electronic components and is not connected directly to the mains voltage. It can include one or more of the following: optical elements, light converters (phosphors), thermal, mechanical and electric interfaces or parts to address electrostatic discharge concerns. Any light-emitting devices that are intended to be used directly in an LED luminaire, are considered to be light sources; (9) \"\" chromaticity \"\" means the property of a colour stimulus defined by its chromaticity coordinates (x and y); (10) \"\"luminous flux\"\" or \"\"flux\"\" (Φ), expressed in lumen (lm), means the quantity derived from radiant flux (radiant power) by evaluating the electromagnetic radiation in accordance with the spectral sensitivity of the human eye. It refers to the total flux emitted by a light source in a solid angle of 4π steradians under conditions (e.g. current, voltage, temperature) specified in applicable standards. It refers to the initial flux for the undimmed light source after a short operating period, unless it is clearly specified that the flux in a dimmed condition or the flux after a given period of operation is intended. For light sources that can be tuned to emit different light spectra and/or different maximum light intensities, it refers to the flux in the \"\"reference control settings\"\" as defined in Annex I; (11) \"\"colour rendering index\"\" (CRI) means a metric quantifying the effect of an illuminant on the colour appearance of objects by conscious or subconscious comparison with their colour appearance under the reference illuminant and is the average Ra of the colour rendering for the first 8 test colours (R1-R8) defined in standards; (12) \"\" incandescence \"\" means the phenomenon where light is produced from heat, in light sources typically produced through a threadlike conductor (\"\"filament\"\") which is heated by the passage of an electric current; (13) \"\" halogen light source \"\" means an incandescent light source with a threadlike conductor made from tungsten surrounded by gas containing halogens or halogen compounds; (14) \"\"fluorescence\"\" or \"\"fluorescent light source\"\" (FL) means the phenomenon or a light source using an electric gas discharge of the low-pressure mercury type in which most of the light is emitted by one or more layers of phosphors excited by the ultraviolet radiation from the discharge. Fluorescent light sources may have one (\"\"single-capped\"\") or two (\"\"double-capped\"\") connections (\"\"caps\"\") to their electricity supply. For the purposes of this Regulation, magnetic induction light sources are also considered as fluorescent light sources; (15) \"\"high intensity discharge\"\" (HID) means an electric gas discharge in which the light- producing arc is stabilised by wall temperature and the arc chamber has a bulb wall loading in excess of 3 watts per square centimetre. HID light sources are limited to metal halide, high-pressure sodium and mercury vapour types, as defined in Annex I; (16) \"\" gas discharge \"\" means a phenomenon where light is produced, directly or indirectly, by an electric discharge through a gas, plasma, metal vapour or mixture of gases and vapours; (17) \"\"inorganic light emitting diode\"\" (LED) means a technology in which light is produced from a solid state device embodying a p-n junction of inorganic material. The junction emits optical radiation when excited by an electric current; (18) \"\"organic light emitting diode\"\" (OLED) means a technology in which light is produced from a solid state device embodying a p-n junction of organic material. The junction emits optical radiation when excited by an electric current; (19) \"\"high-pressure sodium light source\"\" (HPS) means a high intensity discharge light source in which the light is produced mainly by radiation from sodium vapour operating at a partial pressure of the order of 10 kilopascals. HPS light sources may have one (\"\"single-ended\"\") or two (\"\"double-ended\"\") connectors to their electricity supply. (20) \"\" equivalent model \"\" means a model with the same technical characteristics relevant for the ecodesign requirements, but that is placed on the market or put into service by the same manufacturer or importer as another model with a different model identifier; (21) \"\" model identifier \"\" means the code, usually alphanumeric, which distinguishes a specific product model from other models with the same trade mark or the same manufacturer\\"
